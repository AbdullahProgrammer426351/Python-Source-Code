# sets are also like lists and tupels, but in sets, values cannot be repeated

# syntax : 
s = {1,2,6,2}# 2 is reapeating, but will be ignored
print(s)

# NOTE : there is no garanty of maintaining order. When you use elements of multi datatypes


# to make empty set, you can do like this:
ss = set() # {} --> wrong way
